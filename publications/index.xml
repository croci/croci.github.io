      <description>M. Croci, K. E. Willcox, S. J. Wright, Multi-output multilevel best linear unbiased estimators via semidefinite programming, Computer Methods in Applied Mechanics and Engineering (2023). Article. Software. Multifidelity forward uncertainty quantification (UQ) problems often involve multiple quantities of interest and heterogeneous models (e.g., different grids, equations, dimensions, physics, surrogate and reduced-order models). While computational efficiency is key in this context, multi-output strategies in multilevel/multifidelity methods are either sub-optimal or non-existent. In this paper we extend multilevel best linear unbiased estimators (MLBLUE) to multi-output forward UQ problems and we present new semidefinite programming formulations for their optimal setup.</description>

      <description>M. Croci, G. Rosilho de Souza, Mixed-precision explicit stabilized Runge-Kutta methods for single- and multi-scale differential equations, Journal of Computational Physics (2022). Article. Slides. Mixed-precision algorithms combine low- and high-precision computations in order to benefit from the performance gains of reduced-precision without sacrificing accuracy. In this work, we design mixed-precision Runge-Kutta-Chebyshev (RKC) methods, where high precision is used for accuracy, and low precision for stability. Generally speaking, RKC methods are low-order explicit schemes with a stability domain growing quadratically with the number of function evaluations.</description>

      <description>M. Kloewer, S. Hatfield, M. Croci, P. Dueben, T. Palmer, Fluid simulations accelerated with 16 bit: Approaching 4x speedup on A64FX by squeezing ShallowWaters.jl into Float16, Journal of Advances in Modeling Earth Systems (2021). Article. Most Earth-system simulations run on conventional CPUs in 64-bit double precision floating-point numbers Float64, although the need for high-precision calculations in the presence of large uncertainties has been questioned. Fugaku, currently the world’s fastest supercomputer, is based on A64FX microprocessors, which also support the 16-bit low-precision format Float16.</description>

      <description>M. Croci, M. Fasi, N. J. Higham, T. Mary, M. Mikaitis, Stochastic Rounding: Implementation, Error Analysis and Applications, Royal Society Open Science (2022). Article. Stochastic rounding randomly maps a real number to one of the two nearest values in a finite precision number system. First proposed for use in computer arithmetic in the 1950s, it is attracting renewed interest. If used in floating-point arithmetic in the computation of the inner product of two vectors of length n, it yields an error bounded by \sqrt(n)u with high probability, where u is the unit roundoff, which is not necessarily the case for round to nearest.</description>

      <description>M. Croci, M. B. Giles, Effects of round-to-nearest and stochastic rounding in the numerical solution of the heat equation in low precision, IMA Journal of Numerical Analysis (2022). Preprint. Slides. Motivated by the advent of machine learning, the last few years saw the return of hardware-supported low-precision computing. Computations with fewer digits are faster and more memory and energy efficient, but can be extremely susceptible to rounding errors. An application that can largely benefit from the advantages of low-precision computing is the numerical solution of partial differential equations (PDEs), but a careful implementation and rounding error analysis are required to ensure that sensible results can still be obtained.</description>

      <description>M. Croci, M. B. Giles, M. E. Rognes, and P. E. Farrell, Multilevel quasi Monte Carlo methods for elliptic partial differential equations driven by spatial white noise, SIAM Journal on Scientific Computing. Preprint, Talk. When solving partial differential equations driven by additive spatial white noise, the efficient sampling of white noise realizations can be challenging. In this paper we focus on the efficient sampling of white noise using quasi-random points in a finite element method and multilevel Quasi Monte Carlo (MLQMC) setting.</description>

      <description>M. Croci, V. Vinje and M. E. Rognes, Fast uncertainty quantification of tracer distribution in the brain interstitial fluid with multilevel and quasi Monte Carlo, International Journal for Numerical Methods in Biomedical Engineering. Preprint. Efficient uncertainty quantification algorithms are key to understand the propagation of uncertainty &amp;ndash; from uncertain input parameters to uncertain output quantities &amp;ndash; in high resolution mathematical models of brain physiology. Advanced Monte Carlo methods such as quasi Monte Carlo (QMC) and multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC) have the potential to dramatically improve upon standard Monte Carlo (MC) methods, but their applicability and performance in biomedical applications is underexplored.</description>

      <description>M. Croci and P. E. Farrell, Complexity bounds on supermesh construction for quasi-uniform meshes, Journal of Computational Physics 414 (2020), pp. 1–7. Article. Preprint. Projecting fields between different meshes commonly arises in computational physics. This operation may require a supermesh construction and in this case its computational cost is proportional to the number of cells of the supermesh n. Given any two quasi-uniform meshes of nA and nB cells respectively, we show under standard assumptions that n is proportional to nA + nB.</description>

      <description>M. Croci, V. Vinje, M. E. Rognes, Uncertainty quantification of parenchymal tracer distribution using random diffusion and convective velocity fields, Fluids and Barriers of the CNS 16-1 (2019), pp. 1-32. Article. Background: Influx and clearance of substances in the brain parenchyma occur by a combination of diffusion and convection, but the relative importance of thiese mechanisms is unclear. Accurate modeling of tracer distributions in the brain relies on parameters that are partially unknown and with literature values varying up to 7 orders of magnitude.</description>

      <description>M. Croci, M. B. Giles, M. E. Rognes, and P. E. Farrell, Efficient white noise sampling and coupling for multilevel Monte Carlo with non-nested meshes, SIAM/ASA Journal on Uncertainty Quantification 6-4 (2018), pp. 1630-1655. Article. Talk. When solving stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) driven by additive spatial white noise, the efficient sampling of white noise realizations can be challenging. Here, we present a new sampling technique that can be used to efficiently compute white noise samples in a finite element method (FEM) and multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC) setting.</description>

      <description>P. E. Farrell, M. Croci, T. M. Surowiec, Deflation for semismooth equations, Optimization Methods and Software (2020) - Charles Broyden prize for best OMS paper in 2020. Article. Variational inequalities can in general support distinct solutions. In this paper we study an algorithm for computing distinct solutions of a variational inequality, with- out varying the initial guess supplied to the solver. The central idea is the combi- nation of a semismooth Newton method with a deflation operator that eliminates known solutions from consideration.</description>

      <description>M. Croci, J. Munoz-Matute, Exploiting Kronecker structure in exponential integrators: Fast approximation of the action of phi-functions of matrices via quadrature, Journal of Computational Science (2023) Article, Preprint. In this article, we propose an algorithm for approximating the action of phi-functions of matrices against vectors, which is a key operation in exponential time integrators. In particular, we consider matrices with Kronecker sum structure, which arise from problems admitting a tensor product representation.</description>

      <description>J. Enderlein, D. Sakhapov, I. Gregor, M. Croci, N. Karedla, Modeling charge separation in charged nanochannels for single-molecule electrometry, The Journal of Chemical Physics (2022) Article, Preprint. We model the transport of electrically charged solute molecules by a laminar flow within a nanoslit microfluidic channel with electrostatic surface potential. We derive the governing convection–diffusion equation, solve it numerically, and compare it with a Taylor–Aris-like approximation, which gives excellent results for small Péclet numbers.</description>
