      <description>M. Croci, A.-L. Haji-Ali, I. C. J. Powell, An adaptive sampling algorithm for level-set approximation, Preprint (2025). Preprint. We propose a new numerical scheme for approximating level-sets of Lipschitz multivariate functions which is robust to stochastic noise. The algorithm&amp;rsquo;s main feature is an adaptive grid-based stochastic approximation strategy which automatically refines the approximation over regions close to the level set. This strategy combines a local function approximation method with a noise reduction scheme and produces $\varepsilon$-accurate approximations with an expected cost complexity reduction of $\varepsilon^{-(p+1)/(\alpha p)}$ compared to a non-adaptive scheme, where $\alpha$ is the convergence rate of the function approximation method and we assume that the noise can be controlled in $L^p$.</description>

      <description>M. Croci, G. N. Wells, Mixed-precision finite element kernels and assembly: Rounding error analysis and hardware acceleration, Preprint (2024). Preprint. Software. In this paper we develop the first fine-grained rounding error analysis of finite element (FE) cell kernels and assembly. The theory includes mixed-precision implementations and accounts for hardware-acceleration via matrix multiplication units, thus providing theoretical guidance for designing reduced- and mixed-precision FE algorithms on CPUs and GPUs. Guided by this analysis, we introduce hardware-accelerated mixed-precision implementation strategies which are provably robust to low-precision computations.</description>

      <description>M. Croci, K. E. Willcox, S. J. Wright, Multi-output multilevel best linear unbiased estimators via semidefinite programming, Computer Methods in Applied Mechanics and Engineering (2023). Article. Software. Multifidelity forward uncertainty quantification (UQ) problems often involve multiple quantities of interest and heterogeneous models (e.g., different grids, equations, dimensions, physics, surrogate and reduced-order models). While computational efficiency is key in this context, multi-output strategies in multilevel/multifidelity methods are either sub-optimal or non-existent. In this paper we extend multilevel best linear unbiased estimators (MLBLUE) to multi-output forward UQ problems and we present new semidefinite programming formulations for their optimal setup.</description>

      <description>M. Croci, G. Rosilho de Souza, Mixed-precision explicit stabilized Runge-Kutta methods for single- and multi-scale differential equations, Journal of Computational Physics (2022). Article. Slides. Mixed-precision algorithms combine low- and high-precision computations in order to benefit from the performance gains of reduced-precision without sacrificing accuracy. In this work, we design mixed-precision Runge-Kutta-Chebyshev (RKC) methods, where high precision is used for accuracy, and low precision for stability. Generally speaking, RKC methods are low-order explicit schemes with a stability domain growing quadratically with the number of function evaluations.</description>

      <description>M. Croci, G. N. Wells, Reduced- and mixed-precision finite element kernels, FEniCS 2024. Simula Research Laboratory, Oslo, Norway, (2024). Download. In this talk we investigate the effect of rounding errors in the computation of finite element (FE) kernels and we develop strategies for reduced- and mixed-precision acceleration using half-precision floating point formats. Possible applications of this work include: reduced- and mixed-precision preconditioning, linear and nonlinear solvers, and timestepping methods.&#xA;The popularity of artificial intelligence has pushed for the design of computer architectures that are increasingly faster at performing computations using fewer bits.</description>

Palmer, Fluid simulations accelerated with 16 bit: Approaching 4x speedup on A64FX by squeezing ShallowWaters.jl into Float16, Journal of Advances in Modeling Earth Systems (2021). Article. Most Earth-system simulations run on conventional CPUs in 64-bit double precision floating-point numbers Float64, although the need for high-precision calculations in the presence of large uncertainties has been questioned. Fugaku, currently the world’s fastest supercomputer, is based on A64FX microprocessors, which also support the 16-bit low-precision format Float16.</description>

      <description>M. Croci, Multilevel Monte Carlo methods for the approximation of failure probability regions, Computational Mathematics and Applications Seminar, University of Oxford, UK (2024). Download. In this talk, we consider the problem of approximating failure regions. More specifically, given a costly computational model with random parameters and a failure condition, our objective is to determine the parameter region in which the failure condition is likely to not be satisfied. In mathematical terms, this problem can be cast as approximating the level set of a probability density function.</description>

      <description>M. Croci, M. Fasi, N. J. Higham, T. Mary, M. Mikaitis, Stochastic Rounding: Implementation, Error Analysis and Applications, Royal Society Open Science (2022). Article. Stochastic rounding randomly maps a real number to one of the two nearest values in a finite precision number system. First proposed for use in computer arithmetic in the 1950s, it is attracting renewed interest. If used in floating-point arithmetic in the computation of the inner product of two vectors of length n, it yields an error bounded by \sqrt(n)u with high probability, where u is the unit roundoff, which is not necessarily the case for round to nearest.</description>

Motivated by the advent of machine learning, the last few years saw the return of hardware-supported reduced-precision computing. Computations with fewer digits are faster and more memory and energy efficient, but a careful implementation and rounding error analysis are required to ensure that sensible results can still be obtained.

Motivated by the advent of machine learning, the last few years saw the return of hardware-supported low-precision computing. Computations with fewer digits are faster and more memory and energy efficient, but can be extremely susceptible to rounding errors. An application that can largely benefit from the advantages of low-precision computing is the numerical solution of partial differential equations (PDEs), but a careful implementation and rounding error analysis are required to ensure that sensible results can still be obtained.</description>

      <description>M. Croci, V. Vinje and M. E.

Preprint. Efficient uncertainty quantification algorithms are key to understand the propagation of uncertainty &amp;ndash; from uncertain input parameters to uncertain output quantities &amp;ndash; in high resolution mathematical models of brain physiology. Advanced Monte Carlo methods such as quasi Monte Carlo (QMC) and multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC) have the potential to dramatically improve upon standard Monte Carlo (MC) methods, but their applicability and performance in biomedical applications is underexplored.</description>

This talk consists of two parts. In the first, we develop two new strategies for spatial white noise and Gaussian-Matérn field sampling that work within a non-nested multilevel (quasi) Monte Carlo (ML(Q)MC) hierarchy. In the second, we apply the techniques developed to quantify the level of uncertainty in a new stochastic model for tracer transport in the brain.</description>

      <description>M. Croci and P. E. Farrell, Complexity bounds on supermesh construction for quasi-uniform meshes, Journal of Computational Physics 414 (2020), pp. 1–7. Article. Preprint. Projecting fields between different meshes commonly arises in computational physics. This operation may require a supermesh construction and in this case its computational cost is proportional to the number of cells of the supermesh n. Given any two quasi-uniform meshes of nA and nB cells respectively, we show under standard assumptions that n is proportional to nA + nB.</description>

Background: Influx and clearance of substances in the brain parenchyma occur by a combination of diffusion and convection, but the relative importance of thiese mechanisms is unclear. Accurate modeling of tracer distributions in the brain relies on parameters that are partially unknown and with literature values varying up to 7 orders of magnitude.</description>

Variational inequalities can in general support distinct solutions. In this paper we study an algorithm for computing distinct solutions of a variational inequality, with- out varying the initial guess supplied to the solver. The central idea is the combi- nation of a semismooth Newton method with a deflation operator that eliminates known solutions from consideration.</description>
